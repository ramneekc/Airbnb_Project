# Findings
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb's San Francisco listings dataset to understand trends and impacts on the local housing market.
- Investigated rent price spikes in neighborhoods like the Financial District, Bayview, and Russian Hill, identifying rent prices nearing $5,000/month.
- Discovered a high ratio of listings with extensive availability, indicating potential illegal listings and displacement of local residents.
- Identified multiple hosts managing numerous properties, with some like Zeus holding 248 listings, highlighting a potential breach of the "One Host, One Home" rule.
- Analyzed pricing trends, noting an average price increase over the years and a significant drop post-2016 due to stricter Airbnb regulations by the city.
