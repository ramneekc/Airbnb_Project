# Airbnb_Project
Analysed Airbnb dataset on the San Francisco listings. 

# The Issue
● San Francisco has seen enormous spikes in rent prices in the last 5 years.  
● Neighborhoods such as the Financial District, Bayview, and Russian Hill are seeing rent prices hitting nearly $5,000/month

# Findings
Availability:  
○ More High Availability Listings than Low Availability Listings  
○ Higher Chance of illegal listings, vacant home owners, and displacement of locals 

Hosts  
○ There are many hosts that hold multiple (>1) properties on Air BnB and property management companies such as Zeus holds high number of listings (248)  
○ Highest reviewed hosts are not reflected based on affordable pricing  

Price   
○ Average Prices have fluctuated over the years, but all in all are showing an upward trend   
○ There was a big drop from 2016 to 2017, and that was due to the implementation of stricter rules on Air BnB from city of SF

Listings   
○ There are far more listings listed as “Entire Homes” or “Private Rooms” than “Shared Rooms” ■ Shared rooms only take 2% of the total listings   
 * Perhaps this means people don’t like staying with strangers on the road *
 
 # Conclusion  
 
There are many listers not adhering to the “One Host, One Home” rule.  
More than 50% of available listings are Highly available, meaning less locals are able to purchase affordable housing in the area.   
There are multiple property management companies that list multiple properties on the website.
